    And the following details are valid:
      | Detail         | Default value | Valid if                                                                  |
      | Voucher amount | Â£100          | Selected or amount from a list with pre-set values                        |
      | Your message   | Blank         | Non-blank and maximum of 255 characters, including spaces and punctuation |
    Then the customer should be able to add the voucher to their shopping bag
