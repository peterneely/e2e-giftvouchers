Sample automation tests using Ruby, Cucumber and the PageObject gem -- among others.

Start at features/*.feature, then find the step definitions in features/step_definitions.

The page object pattern is demonstrated in features/support/pages.

Other gem usage (for abstracting sample data and environment configurations) can be seen under the config folder.

This is a more extensive demonstration of the above technologies than my other e2e demo project at https://github.com/peterneely/e2e-sample.
